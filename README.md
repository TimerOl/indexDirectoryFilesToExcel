This script was created by me inSeptember 2021.
The purpose of the script is creation of excel file that have a list of files and hyperlinks from the directory and subfolders.
For running this .EXE file, just copy ot to the destination directory and run.
If you want to run the .py script , you will need have the python 3 installed on your mashine.
Maybee you will have some issues with antivirus endpoint solution.
